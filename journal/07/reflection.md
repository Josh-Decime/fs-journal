# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?


These last 2 assignments have had a ton to them, & 2 of them back to back is a lot! It is definitely building our endurance for coding larger projects. I thought about it several weeks ago, looking back at some old projects, it seemed almost funny that I used to think those were difficult & it took so long. We are moving so fast in this course!
