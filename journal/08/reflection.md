# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?


Switching to a more open ended assignment has been a nice change of pace. I liked building out the Figma for the capstone, & will definitely enjoy preplanning projects in the future. Iv been struggling with the motivation to work on the backend, I find it much less enjoyable than working with the frontend.
