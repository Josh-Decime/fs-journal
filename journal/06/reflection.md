I really love Vue! it makes building things so much more intuitive & quicker! Components are a little tricky to get the hang of but i love their versatility & see how they could greatly speed up the process & I love functions that are very flexible & can be used for many things. Im still not a huge fan of working with api's to generate content, after the 2 week break it was a rough adjustment back to using them. The fact that I kept coding the entire 2 week break was a huge victory! It proved to myself that I will be able to continue coding, & enjoy it, even after we graduate from this class! I brought the game I was building out to a further point that I was expecting, especially for practicing a framework I have never used before!
