## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?


I have had a colossal amount of external stressors that I have been struggling with. Iv had money issues after an unexpected payment for insurance I canceled back in august over-drafted my account by $1000, right before bills are due & the refunded money wont arrive for at least a week. Relationship issues because quality time is our shared love language & we barely see each other anymore, so we officially broke up but have still been on & off talking. A looming custody battle to get full custody of my son, because I worry my baby momma is a danger to his safety. Worries about the state of the job market with all the mass layoffs & very few available junior dev jobs, linkedin is a sea of developers with the green "open to work" tag on their profile photo. 

I would count the fact that I have continued to chip away at coding & completed all of the postman tests for the back end of the Noter project, despite everything else going on, as a victory! Jake mentioned that coding for him is his happy place away from external stressors, & I admire that! For me, I feel that way about art & I am hoping that one day I feel like that way about coding as well!
