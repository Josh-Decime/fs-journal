# Working in a Professional Environment
01. What is Inheritance?

> it is a fundamental concept for object oriented programming where a subclass can inherit attributes & behaviors from a superclass, which allows the creation of specialized classes that extend or modify other existing classes. This promotes code reusability

02. What is the `Singleton` design pattern?

> it is a GoF Creation pattern, they only allow for one class, has a global access point to create the instance. It is used when you need strict control over global variables. According to linkedin it is like a coffee maker


03. What is the `Observer` design pattern?

04. What is the `Strategy` design pattern?

> it is a behavioral pattern for when there are multiple algorithms for specific tasks, the client decides what is implemented at runtime.

05. What is the `Factory` design pattern?

> it is used in object oriented programming that allows the creation of objects that don't have a specified class that is instantiated. Its like a production line being modified in a factory.

06. What is test driven development?

> It is where you test code, fix it & refactor. There are a ton of different graphs & most of them all say different things that are roughly the same. Isn't this basically what all development looks like? 

07. In Scrum/Agile what is the DoD?

> Definition of Done is the formal definition of quality for the product backlog items

08. Give two examples of a user story:

> conversation & confirmation 

09. During which ceremony is your Sprint Backlog created?

> it is initially created during the sprint planning meeting but can be updated at any point through the process

10. In which of these ceremonies are Tasks assigned to you?

> it is created during the sprint planning meeting
