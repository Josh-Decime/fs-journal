I did not enjoy this week at all!!! I felt like I had a good understanding of the MVC pattern on the first day. I was able to follow the order of what had to be made first & vaguely understood how things were moving, even though I didn't understand what the code was really doing so I had no idea how things were communicating or how variables were getting defined or any of that. The second day added way more complexity & I became super lost, I no longer understood how things were moving around & I was lost with no idea what I even needed to build or where it needed to be. It just went down hill from there, I feel like every day I'm just even more lost & confused than I was the day before. It is getting extremely frustrating & I don't even know what I am struggling with, what I do or don't know... I just feel like im completely lost & just stumbling around. I cant even touch on styling anything at all because I spend all of the time struggling through the javascript, so I don't even get a little bit of what Im actually enjoying in this process. I got no enjoyment from this week at all!! I need tutoring but I don't even know what to say in the ticket asking for help.. feels like I need help with ALL of Javascript & MVC!
