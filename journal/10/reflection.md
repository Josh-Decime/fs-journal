# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?


Im exhausted this week, emotionally & physically. My ex & I aren't talking anymore after a huge fight, but I still see her when I go to the gym so its just that much more painful. It has been so hard to sleep, it takes several hours to finally fall sleep & then i just wake up from a nightmare & cant sleep anymore. Despite that I am making good progress on our last checkpoint before the final. If I am able to complete the backend before the weekend then I will be in a really good place to finish early & aim for stretch goals & indulge in my love for styling!
