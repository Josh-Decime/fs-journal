# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?


Backend was way easier than i thought it was going to be! It is pretty simple & repetitive, normally that drives me crazy but I had a lot of fun filling in data into the database. Thinking of different planets & galaxies was a blast! 

Im very excited to branch off momentarily for some self directed learning over the break before we resume. I think this is a great place to explore on our own for a little while now that we know how to build very simple fullstack apps. I am going to map out the flow of MVC for front-end & back-end & include code examples for each so I can have a better grasp of what we have learned. I am a very visual person so it helps me immensely to see it mapped out so I can run through the bigger picture of what is happening. 

I also have several projects I am excited to work on! I loved the game mechanics for the murder mystery game demo so I am going to build that out & potentially elaborate on it. I want to utilize what we have learned this week & make something fullstack. It isn't immediately apparent how I would integrate the murder mystery to be fullstack, I can think of some simple ways but it isn't the best candidate. I could build it out in a day or two, depending on how nice I want to make it, so I might make it & then move to another project. 

I am going to build out a style css collection that includes the most common style elements I need & some extra fun ones, like glowing buttons. I will also make some color pallets & apply them to all the different functions. It is essentially going to by my own styling bootstrap. I have been wanting to do more styling but it has been to time consuming to devote my time to with how fast paced our projects are, with this I will have all the styling done ahead of time so it will be fast to implement.

Have a merry christmas!!
