# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?


I had a pretty easy time doing the backend, since that has been my main focus the last couple weeks. I felt a little rusty with the front end when I started up again but I got the hang of it pretty quick. Time for the FINAL!!! Crazy its that time already!
