# Foundations of Web Development
01. In your own words, why do we use Git?
    > It is a convenient place to share code & store multiple iterations to show a history of progression. It is also commonly reviewed by recruiters when they consider an applicant.

02. In the terminal, what is the command `mkdir` used for?
    > It is used to make a directory

03. What is a ***pseudo-class*** and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?
    > It is a keyword for a selector that targets an element in a specific state. Hover state is probably going to be my favorite because I can use it to make things glow!

04. What is ***specificity*** and how might you use it to your benefit?
    > Specificity is how the code knows which rule to follow if multiple rules are targeting the same element. Im not yet sure how I could use it to my benefit, I thought it was more like a failsafe incase code gets messy. 

05. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the `!important` feature?
    > It makes them the most important so they take specificity, If you over utilize it then you might cause a situation where 2 !important are fighting each other. The reading also mentions that it is bad practice 

06. What are the three components that makeup a `CSS` rule? <br> Example:

    ```css
        h1 {
            color: rgba(255, 210, 33, .75);
        }
    ```

    > The three components that make up a CSS rule are selector, property, & value.

07. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website, and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
    > Good design has a flow through the website, guiding the visitors eye across the page to the important aspect. It sets the tone by conveying a theme that sends a message about the purpose of the site. It also makes it easier to find what you are looking for. It makes a huge impact! Poorly designed websites are terrible to have to interact with

08. What is the purpose of ***wireframing***?
    > Wireframing quickly lays out the design of a website. It allows you to think about how the site will flow. Once you are ready to code it serves as a very helpful guide so you know what needs to be built.

09. Do you think wireframes are worth the time, energy, and effort that they require? Why or Why not?
    > Absolutely! Having an idea of what the website should look like ahead of time is critical for how it will turn out. Someone who has been coding for a long time & has a strong understanding of it & has made many websites might be able to just code out a good looking site off the top of their head. But for someone who is learning, I have to have a reference.

10. Define the display `:flex property:`
    > display: flex allows you to quickly & easily change the order of the elements which it affects 

11. What `CSS` properties affect the size of a box model?
    > height & width
