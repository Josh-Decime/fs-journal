# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?


I really enjoyed building out the webpages! It was a lot of fun to come up with what the website should be about & I LOVE styling! I had a blast putting title tags on stuff to just add some subtle bit of fun into it. The container, row, column order is a little difficult to work with but im making improvements.
