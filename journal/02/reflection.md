Javascript is HARD!! But I loved making games so I toughed through it so I could enjoy having a working game. I have to reference code super closely & really struggle to write ANYTHING without a reference. I understand the concepts of what has to be done, I can easily pseudo-code what needs to happen but when it comes to translating that into Javascript code I am just at a complete loss & have no clue how to even start building anything unless I can find an example of how it is done. It brings me so much joy when I have a game rendered out onto the page & its playable! I wish I had more time to get more in depth with it!
