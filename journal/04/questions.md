# Understanding Asynchronous Code, and API's
01. What is the difference between `asynchronous` code and `synchronous` code?

  > Asynchronous code allows you to wait for code to receive an input before it continues running & the rest of your code continues on in the meantime. 

02. What is an event listener?

  > An event listener allows you to watch for changes in another part of the code & trigger an action once a change is detected. 

03. What does *REST* stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean??

  > REST is n architectural guideline of how an API 'should' work.

04. What is a callback / higher order function?

  > a higher order function is a function that takes in arguments from other functions &/or returns a function as a value. A callback function is the function that is used as an argument in the higher order function.

05. What is a `promise`? How do you capture an error from a `promise`?

  > Promise is a proxy for a value that is not available right away. It is used in Async functions & once the promise is fulfilled  

06. Name three processes used to make requests over `HTTP`?

  > Processes that make requests over HTTP are get, delete, post, put, & patch  

07. What does the `API` acronym stand for?

  > It stands for Application Programming Interface

08. What must you do in order to `await` a promise inside of a function?

  > It has to be an async function & then you use the keyword await 

09. What is the purpose of encapsulation in programming?

  > encapsulation hides parts of your code so it is protected from unauthorized access

10. What is `HTTP` response code for a successful request?

  > 200, 201 & 202. All the 200s generally mean its successful-ish

11. What is a 400 error?

  > Bad request
