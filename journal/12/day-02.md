# Daily Reflection
Two full days in! Did you make the progress you were hoping for yesterday and today? Are you working from client -> server or focusing only on the server for now?  

## Prompts
- How is today going? 
- Are you managing your stress?
- What has you most worried?


I was so focused on the final I forgot to fill out my daily reflections. I passed my final on thursday ðŸ¥³

After finishing the final I focused on my resume & linkedin for the next week, & then I took a week off to spend quality time with my family & refresh before continuing on with my journey!
