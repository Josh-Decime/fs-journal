# Daily Reflection
This is a stressful week! You are working on a project that closely mimics what you will be expected to accomplish during a standard 40 hour work week. Are you enjoying the struggles? Are you managing your time wisely? 

## Prompts
- How is today going? 
- Are you managing your stress?
- What has you most worried?

((BONUS DAYS))
FRIDAY: It went really well, I think taking a bit of time to cool off & not run my stress so high paid off because I feel ready to tackle this assignment! I don't feel as burnt out as I was. I was able to get a lot of the backend done. I got all of the Keeps postman tests passing & all of the Vaults tests passing except the ones that require IsPrivate checks.

SATURDAY: I think I could have optimized my time better today, I spend a lot of time being stuck on problems. I got all the rest of the Vaults postman tests working, which was an early victory for the day. But I just don't quite understand how VaultKeeps are supposed to work. While I wait for a reply to my questions I asked over slack I started working on the front end. I enjoy the styling side so much & want it to look perfect so it is easy for me to lose time fixing styling problems that have a little impact towards passing the project. I could not get masonry style to work for the life of me, I looked at Post It which was the reference that is supposed to have masonry but I couldn't figure it out & bootstraps says it doesn't natively support it so you have to inject something else, that cant be right so I'll just leave it as is & ask on monday.

SUNDAY: I did not have as much time as i would have liked to work today, but i kept going on the front end & am able to create keeps

MONDAY: I completed all of the postman tests!!! The backend isn't 100% completed yet because I still need to add counts for views & kept in vaults. I am on great pace to finish in time.
