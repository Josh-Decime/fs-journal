# JavaScript

*** import javascript with <script src="app.js"></script>
place inside <body>

methods are fancy functions. exists on an object.

first letter of first word lower cased, any subsequent word first letter is capitalized. example: turkeysGobbled

everything is an object in javascript

in booleans 0 is falsy and any other number is truth
anything undefined is falsy

null is for purposefully not assigning a value

reference data-types, vs primitive
in primitive: 0, null, undefined = falsy
empty array or objects are still truthy

arrays are a collection of things

push changes the value 

key value pairs is like a hashmap

objects and parameters are black magic

event listener (on click)

***start every function with a console.log can help with debugging

don't forget to evoke a function () without that, it wont do anything

if you get undefined, there might be a typo in the variable/function name between your HTML vs Javascript 

+ doesn't reassign value += does

{} object 
[] array

function(variable) variable can get defined this way, acts as if we said let variable

return ends it at that point in the code line so it wont continue on
return instead of else is actually most efficient for checking conditions

const nameOfCopy = { ...whatsBeingCopied} copies another const without changing variables to the original if changes are made to the copy

concatination

functions bust be evoked ()

find is like a for-loop with an if statement

'' string.. no quotes it looks for a variable


** multiply multiple squares the number

p tag around animal emoji

window + v gives your paste history clipboard

|| creates an or statement


in querySelector
'#' grabs by id
. is a selector

setInterval to make time counters
setTimeout delays the execution of a function by the time that is set (in milliseconds) once

localStorage to save information, for a scoreboard  ((can check on storage in Application))

parseInt converts string into integer
toString makes integer into string

shift moves one over in the array. You can shift to change across an array (takes something off the front)
push adds an item to the end... create a change function, give their health back & push them to the back of the array with updated stats

uniqueInfoFromArr.find    (find grabs the whole object out of an array by the unique identifying aspect)

******for testing you cant adjust your code

research more about =>

document.getElementById(array.identifier)

classList allows you to edit within a class tag in the element that you have grabbed 
personElm.classList.remove('d-none')
instead of remove you can toggle

math.round rounds a number so you wont have decimals
